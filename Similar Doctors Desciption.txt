Similar Doctors Program Description - Sujay Kestur

Similar Doctors is a program that allows a user to browse a list of doctors. 
The user may filter the list based on the doctor's Speciality (General Practioner, Surgery
or Pediatrics), Area (North, South, East or West) or Review Score (1, 2, 3, 4 or 5)
The user can then click on any of the listed doctors and the details for the doctor are 
displayed which include their name, speciality, area, review score and a list of similar 
doctors.

Assumptions made:
1) "Similar" is defined as having the same speciality, area or review score. The similar 
doctors section of the details is divided according to the filter.
2) The user can only apply one filter: Speciality, Area or Review Score, at a time. The 
other two filter's will default to  "all" to show the rest of the doctors in that filter.
3) All doctors are stored in the program code and filters. If another doctor is to be 
added, they must be added to all aspects of the code, including their respective filters.

Time Spent: 3 hours

Given more time, I would like to add a way to import doctors into the program so they
don't each need to be hard-coded into every part of the code. I would also like to add 
buttons to the similar doctors so that the user can click them and be redirected to the 
selected doctor. Finally, I would also add the option to apply multiple filters so the 
user can filter the doctors more if they wish.
